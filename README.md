# virtualPet
This is a virtual Pet Project that was created with a programming language named Tranquility designed by Dr. Stuart Brian. We had to code a pet which would commit to certain actions, and create documentation in HTML on what actions our pet will complete. 
Located here is the documentation for the virtual Pet Project, which shows the combination of states, interactions, transitions, timers and time outs: https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~amv97/milo-the-cat.html
Located here is the actual Pet Project of Milo the Cat, which was the cat created for the purpose of this project: https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~amv97/virtualPet.html
